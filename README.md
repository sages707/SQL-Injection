# SQL-Injection

#SQL Injection Demo using DVWA (Damn Vulnerable Web Application)

This project demonstrates how SQL Injection can be utilised on web applications. Using Damn Vulnerable Web Application (DVWA), I tested and documented the methodology and techniques used to exploit poorly secured input fields.

Environment & Tools
- Base OS: Debian 12.x (ARM64) via Kali Linux 
- VMware Fusion on macOS M3
- Web App: [DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA)
- Database: MariaDB 11.x
- Web Server: Apache2
- Language: PHP 8.4


Through these various tools, we got to see how SQL injections vulnerabilities were exploited, along with the security level changes that can occur and the effects.
